The final verdict on professional success or failure lies in your mind. Understand that, life is a series of moments defined by binary decisions - the ones we make and the ones we don't. Once the moment has passed, it has passed. Once your decision is final - you must own it (whatever the professional outcome). The thing about life is, it continues to bring defining moments and new opportunities to make good decisions. So where there is life, there is hope. And where there is hope, there is an opportunity for new, renewed and continued professional success.
